## Installation Steps

### 1. Run the Installation Script

Execute the following command to download and run the installer:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkh-python/outline-server-installer/main/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Provide Configuration Details

- **Telegram Bot Token**: Obtain this token by creating a bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
- **Admin IDs**: Add one or more numeric Telegram user IDs to manage the bot. (Enter `n` to finish.)

### 3. Wait for Completion

The script will:
- Install and configure the Outline Server.
- Set up a virtual environment for the bot.
- Install necessary Python dependencies.
- Configure and start the bot as a systemd service.

## Updating the Bot and Server

1. Open your bot in Telegram and click "ðŸ”„ Get Latest Update."
2. The bot will automatically:
   - Check for new versions on GitHub.
   - Download and apply updates.
   - Restart the bot service.

3. Upon successful update, you will receive a confirmation message with the new version.

## Server Details

Upon successful installation, the bot will send the following details to the admin:

- **Server API URL**: Required to manage the server via Outline Manager.
- **Cert SHA256**: Secure key for verifying the connection.
- **Download Links**:
  - Windows: [Outline Manager for Windows](https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-releases/manager/windows/stable/Outline-Manager.exe)
  - Mac: [Outline Manager for Mac](https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-releases/manager/macos/stable/Outline-Manager.dmg)
  - Linux: [Outline Manager for Linux](https://s3.amazonaws.com/outline-releases/manager/linux/stable/Outline-Manager.AppImage)

## How It Works

1. **Outline Server Installation**:
   The script uses the official Outline Manager installer to deploy the server and extract required credentials.

2. **Bot Configuration**:
   - Updates the `outline_bot.py` file with:
     - `OUTLINE_API_URL`
     - `OUTLINE_API_KEY`
     - `CERT_SHA256`
     - Admin IDs
     - Bot token

3. **System Service Setup**:
   Configures a systemd service (`outline_bot.service`) to run the bot persistently.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bot Service Fails to Start

   ```bash
   journalctl -u outline_bot.service -n 50
   ```
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r /opt/outline_bot/requirements.txt
   ```

### Issue: Update Process Fails
**Solution**:
1. Run the update script manually:
   ```bash
   sudo bash /opt/outline_bot/update.sh
   ```
2. Check for errors in `/opt/outline_bot/update.log`.
